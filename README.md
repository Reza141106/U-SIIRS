U-SIIRS — UTeM Smart Infrastructure Issue Reporting System
A web-based platform that empowers UTeM students and staff to report campus infrastructure issues and track their resolution in real time.

Overview
U-SIIRS is a lightweight, framework-free PHP web application built for Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). It provides a structured channel for the university community to submit infrastructure and maintenance reports — broken facilities, electrical faults, cleanliness issues, and more — while giving administrators the tools to triage, prioritize, and resolve them efficiently.

Features
For Users
Submit Reports — Describe an issue with a title, category, location, photo attachment, and priority level
Track Status — Follow each report through Pending → In Progress → Resolved
Edit & Manage — Update or withdraw reports from a personal dashboard
In-App Notifications — Get notified when an admin updates your report status
Contact Form — Reach the admin team directly for general inquiries
For Admins
Admin Dashboard — Overview of all submitted reports with filtering by status and priority
Status Management — Update report status with remarks logged in a full audit trail
User Management — View, ban, or unban registered users
Contact Messages — Read and manage incoming contact form submissions
Security
PDO prepared statements on every database query
password_hash() / password_verify() (bcrypt) for all credentials
CSRF tokens on every form
File uploads validated by MIME type (getimagesize) and renamed to safe filenames
PHP execution blocked in the uploads directory via .htaccess
Access restricted to @utem.edu.my and @student.utem.edu.my email addresses

Getting Started
Requirements
XAMPP (Apache + PHP 7.4+ or PHP 8.x, MySQL/MariaDB)
Installation
Clone or download this repository into your XAMPP htdocs directory:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/u-siirs.git C:/xampp/htdocs/u-siirs
# macOS/Linux: /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/u-siirs
Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.

Import the database — open http://localhost/phpmyadmin, click the Import tab, choose sql/u_siirs.sql, and click Go. This creates the u_siirs database with all tables and a default admin account.

(Optional) If your MySQL root account uses a password, update config/database.php:

$DB_PASS = 'your_password_here';
On Linux/macOS, make the uploads directory writable:

chmod 775 assets/uploads
Visit the app at http://localhost/u-siirs/

Default Admin Account
Field	Value
URL	http://localhost/u-siirs/admin/login.php
Email	admin@utem.edu.my
Password	Admin@123
⚠️ Change the default password immediately after your first login.

Database Schema
Table	Purpose
users	Registered UTeM users
admins	Admin accounts
reports	Infrastructure issue reports
report_attachments	Photos attached to reports
status_updates	Audit log of all status changes
notifications	In-app notifications for users
contact_messages	Contact form submissions
Troubleshooting
Problem	Fix
Database connection failed	Ensure MySQL is running; check credentials in config/database.php
Invalid CSRF token	Clear cookies / restart browser — sessions may have expired
Images not showing	Confirm files exist in assets/uploads and Apache can read them
Login redirect loop	Clear the PHPSESSID cookie for localhost
Path issues	Keep the folder named u-siirs — BASE_URL auto-detects from the folder name
